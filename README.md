# LanguageParser
This project implements a simple lexer and recursive descent parser for a toy programming language called **Hawk**. It reads a source file, tokenizes the input, checks for syntax correctness based on grammar rules, and prints parsing stages with error reporting. Built in C++ to demonstrate core concepts in compiler design.
